# KPM Documentation Template

The purpose of this repository is to have a template from which to create complete and usable documentation.

## 🚀 Usage
The simplest way of using this repository is to copy the source code of `TEMPLATE.md` (found [here](TEMPLATE.md)) to wherever you would like the documentation to appear. Fill in the relevant placeholders and save.

## 📝 Table of Contents
Github doesn't generate Tables of Contents natively, unlike other flavors of Markdown. Since we want to have a Table of Contents for ease of navigation and readability, we will have to generate one. To do so, please follow the instructions [here](TOC.md).

## 🔧 Formatting

### Code
For any code that needs to be included (unless it is a single-word command), please do not use `inline code`. Instead, to aid in readability, please use 
```
code blocks like this
```

### File and Folder Names
For any file and folder names (and one-word commands), use `code quoting` so the delineation is obvious.
