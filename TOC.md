To generate a Table of Contents for Github flavored Markdown, follow the following instructions. Please note, this should be the last step in generating your documentation.

1. First, copy the entire markdown source code.
2. Next, go to [this website](https://ecotrust-canada.github.io/markdown-toc/)
3. Paste your source code into the left-hand pane.
4. The table of contents will be automatically generated in the right-hand pane.
5. Copy the contents of the right-hand pane, and paste it just above the `Installation` section of the documentation.
